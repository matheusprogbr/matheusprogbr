<p>
    I am a 20 year old brazilian Engineering student, FullStack developer and Cyber Security Enthusiast. I am always trying to improve myself and everyday I try to learn a little more to become a better person and professional. I hope one day I will become a master in software development.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ReactJs, NodeJs and Linux
- ðŸ’» I love writing code and learn anythings about it
- âš¡ Fun fact: The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know :sweat_smile:
